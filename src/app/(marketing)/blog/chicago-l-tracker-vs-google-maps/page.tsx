            The Core Difference: Data Source
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 my-4 dark:text-gray-300">
            When you check CTA train times, you expect accuracy. Missed connections or unnecessary waiting are frustrating pain points for daily commuters. The biggest reason for discrepancies between apps often boils down to one thing: where they get their data.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 my-4 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>ChiTrack uses the official, real-time CTA Train Tracker API.</strong> This is the same data feed the CTA uses for its station displays and official website. It provides minute-by-minute updates directly from the source, reflecting actual train positions and predictions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 my-4 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong>Google Maps, on the other hand, often relies on GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data combined with its own algorithms.</strong> While GTFS includes schedules, the real-time component (GTFS-RT) integration can sometimes be delayed or less granular compared to the CTA's native API. This can lead to arrival times that are estimates based on the schedule or slightly outdated real-time info.
          </p>

          <h2 className="!text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4 dark:text-gray-100">
            What This Means for Your Commute
          </h2>
          <ul className="my-6 space-y-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> ChiTrack's direct API access generally provides more reliable and up-to-the-second arrival predictions. You're seeing what the CTA system sees.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Delays, reroutes, or "ghost trains" are more likely to be reflected accurately and quickly in apps using the dedicated API.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus:</strong> ChiTrack is built *specifically* for the Chicago transit user. Features are tailored to CTA riders' needs, like quickly saving favorite stops or seeing uni-directional arrival times, which aren't priorities for a global mapping service.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> While Google Maps does many things, finding specific, accurate CTA times can sometimes involve extra taps. Dedicated trackers prioritize getting you this essential information faster.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="!text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4 dark:text-gray-100">
            When is Google Maps Useful?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 my-4 dark:text-gray-300">
            Google Maps excels at route planning involving multiple modes of transport (walking, driving, transit), finding directions to new places, and exploring points of interest. For a general overview of how to get from A to B using transit, it's a powerful tool.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 my-4 dark:text-gray-300">
            However, for the daily Chicago commuter who relies on precise L train arrival times to plan their departure, a dedicated CTA tracker like ChiTrack, built on the official real-time data feed, offers a significant advantage in accuracy and reliability.
          </p>

            Get the Most Accurate Times
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 my-4 dark:text-gray-300">
            Stop guessing and start tracking with confidence. If dependable, real-time CTA L train information is critical for your commute, using an app directly integrated with the official CTA API is the best way to go.
