**ChiTrack Privacy Policy**  
_Last updated: April 26, 2025_

ChiTrack (“the App”) is a simple Chicago CTA train-tracking tool created by dkBuilds. We respect your privacy and are committed to keeping your data safe and minimal. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

### 1.  What We Collect — Non-Identifiable Data Only

| Data Type | Examples | Purpose | Linked to You? |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Identifiers** | – Randomly-generated User ID<br>– Device ID (Apple-assigned)** | • Ensure core app functionality (e.g., syncing favorites across sessions)<br>• Basic, aggregated analytics | **No** — never combined with personal details |
| **Usage Data** | – Screens viewed<br>– App interaction events (e.g., tapping “Refresh”) | • Diagnose crashes & bugs<br>• Understand feature usage to improve the App | **No** |

**We do *not* collect:**  
* GPS or precise location  
* Contact lists, photos, or files  
* Advertising IDs  
* Personal identifiers (name, email, address, phone)

---

### 2.  How We Use the Data
1. **Operate & maintain the App.** Identifiers let us keep your settings (e.g., chosen stations) tied to your device.  
2. **Improve performance.** Aggregated analytics show which features matter, guiding future updates.  
3. **Detect & fix issues.** Crash logs point us to bugs so we can patch them quickly.

We do **not** use your data for advertising, profiling, or selling to third parties.

---

### 3.  Third-Party Services
ChiTrack does **not** embed advertising SDKs or social media trackers.  
We rely on the following Apple-provided services, which may independently collect limited information (see Apple’s privacy documentation):

* **Apple App Store / TestFlight** – handles app distribution and crash diagnostics.

---

### 4.  Data Retention
* **Identifiers & Usage Data**: retained for up to **24 months**, after which it is automatically deleted or fully anonymized.

---

### 5.  Your Choices & Rights
* **Opt-Out of Analytics** – Disable “Share Analytics” for the App in **iOS Settings › Privacy & Security › Analytics & Improvements**.  
* **Request Deletion** – Email us at **privacy@chitrack.com** with your anonymous User ID (found in _Settings › About_ in the App) and we’ll delete associated data within 30 days.  
* **Regional Rights** – If you reside in a region with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), you may have additional rights (access, correction, portability). Contact us and we’ll help.

---

### 6.  Security
We follow industry-standard practices—encryption in transit (HTTPS) and at rest—to protect the limited data we hold.

---

### 7.  Children’s Privacy
ChiTrack is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from them. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us and we will promptly delete it.

---

### 8.  Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. Material changes will be announced inside the App and on **chitrack.com/privacy** at least 7 days before they take effect.
